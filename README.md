# MATLAB-learning
This repository contains the notes taken by myself while learning MATLAB.  
If you want to learn some basic stuff of MATLAB or GNU Octave, my notes may help you.  
Do not count on memorizing the name of every function and command. It is almost impossible. What you need to do is to keep in mind that there exists these command, and if you forget what its name is, just look it up on the Internet.  
Some of these codes are similar to the examples given by Andrew Ng on his machine learning course.  

## Content in each file
| File Name | Focus on | Content | Resource File |
| :-------- | :------- |:---------|
| note1.m   | basic  | arithmetic, print, matrices | null |
| note2.m   | data   | file, variables, matrix index | myMatrix.dat |
| note3.m   | compute on matrix   | element-wise operations of matrix | null |
| note4.m  | plotting | plot figures and matrices | null |

## How to use these notes
1. Download any .m file.
2. Open it with MATLAB or Octave.
3. If you are using MATLAB, it is highly recommended to `Open with live script` to make it more human-readable.
