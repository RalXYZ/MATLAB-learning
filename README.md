# MATLAB-learning
This repository contains the notes taken by myself while learning MATLAB.  
If you want to learn some basic stuff of MATLAB or GNU Octave, or if you want to do some basic experiments related to machine learning, my notes may help you.  
Some of these codes are similar to the examples given by Andrew Ng on his machine learning course.
